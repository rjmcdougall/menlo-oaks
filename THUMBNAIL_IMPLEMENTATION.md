# Thumbnail Extraction Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive thumbnail extraction and storage functionality for the UniFi Protect license plate detection webhook system. The implementation automatically downloads, processes, and stores thumbnail images in Google Cloud Storage while maintaining all metadata in BigQuery.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components Added

1. **Google Cloud Storage Client (`gcs_client.py`)**
   - Handles thumbnail upload to the `menlo_oaks_thumbnails` bucket
   - Generates organized folder structure: `YYYY/MM/DD/PLATE_HHMMSS_hash_type.jpg`
   - Supports public URLs and signed URLs
   - Automatic lifecycle management (90-day retention by default)

2. **Enhanced UniFi Protect Client (`unifi_protect_client.py`)**
   - Extracts thumbnail URLs from detection events
   - Downloads authenticated images from UniFi Protect API
   - Supports both cropped license plate images and full event snapshots
   - Handles multiple thumbnail types per detection

3. **Extended BigQuery Schema (`bigquery_client.py`)**
   - Added 10 new fields for thumbnail metadata
   - Stores GCS paths, public URLs, file sizes, content types
   - Separate fields for event snapshots and cropped license plates

4. **Enhanced Configuration (`config.py`)**
   - GCS bucket settings and file size limits
   - Retention policies and signed URL expiry
   - Thumbnail processing toggles

## 📋 New BigQuery Fields

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `thumbnail_gcs_path` | STRING | GCS path to event snapshot |
| `thumbnail_public_url` | STRING | Public URL to event snapshot |
| `thumbnail_filename` | STRING | Filename of event snapshot |
| `thumbnail_size_bytes` | INTEGER | Size of event snapshot |
| `thumbnail_content_type` | STRING | MIME type of event snapshot |
| `thumbnail_upload_timestamp` | DATETIME | Upload timestamp |
| `cropped_thumbnail_gcs_path` | STRING | GCS path to license plate crop |
| `cropped_thumbnail_public_url` | STRING | Public URL to license plate crop |
| `cropped_thumbnail_filename` | STRING | Filename of license plate crop |
| `cropped_thumbnail_size_bytes` | INTEGER | Size of license plate crop |

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Core GCS Settings
export GCS_THUMBNAIL_BUCKET="menlo_oaks_thumbnails"
export GCS_BUCKET_LOCATION="US"
export GCS_MAKE_PUBLIC="true"

# File Processing
export GCS_MAX_FILE_SIZE="10485760"    # 10MB default
export GCS_DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT="30"       # 30 seconds
export GCS_RETENTION_DAYS="90"         # 90 days

# Thumbnail Types
export STORE_EVENT_SNAPSHOTS="true"    # Full scene images
export STORE_CROPPED_THUMBNAILS="true" # License plate crops

# Enable thumbnail processing
export STORE_IMAGES="true"
```

### Signed URLs (if not making public)
```bash
export GCS_MAKE_PUBLIC="false"
export GCS_SIGNED_URL_HOURS="24"       # 24-hour signed URLs
```

## 🚀 Processing Flow

### 1. Webhook Receipt
- Receive license plate detection webhook from UniFi Protect
- Extract plate data and enrich with context information

### 2. Thumbnail Processing
For each detected license plate:

**Event Snapshots (Full Scene)**
- Extract `snapshot_url` from webhook data
- Download full scene image showing detection event
- Upload to GCS with organized naming: `2024/01/15/ABC123_143022_a1b2c3d4_event_snapshot.jpg`

**Cropped License Plates**
- Extract `cropped_id` and `camera_id` from detection data
- Generate authenticated URL: `https://protect-host/proxy/protect/api/cameras/{camera_id}/detections/{cropped_id}/thumbnail`
- Download cropped license plate image
- Upload to GCS: `2024/01/15/ABC123_143022_a1b2c3d4_license_plate_crop.jpg`

**Fallback Processing**
- If webhook URLs unavailable, connect directly to UniFi Protect API
- Use authenticated session to download thumbnails
- Async processing with proper connection management

### 3. Storage & Metadata
- Upload images to `menlo_oaks_thumbnails` bucket
- Generate public URLs or signed URLs based on configuration  
- Store all metadata in BigQuery alongside detection data
- Automatic retry and error handling

## 📊 Sample BigQuery Results

After processing, your BigQuery table will contain entries like:

```sql
SELECT 
  plate_number,
  detection_timestamp,
  thumbnail_public_url,
  cropped_thumbnail_public_url,
  thumbnail_size_bytes,
  camera_name
FROM `menlo-oaks.license_plates_dev.detections`
WHERE thumbnail_public_url IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY detection_timestamp DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Sample Result:**
| plate_number | detection_timestamp | thumbnail_public_url | cropped_thumbnail_public_url | thumbnail_size_bytes | camera_name |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 7M15340 | 2024-01-15 14:30:22 | https://storage.googleapis.com/menlo_oaks_thumbnails/2024/01/15/7M15340_143022_a1b2c3d4_event_snapshot.jpg | https://storage.googleapis.com/menlo_oaks_thumbnails/2024/01/15/7M15340_143022_a1b2c3d4_license_plate_crop.jpg | 245678 | Front Gate |

## 🎯 Key Features

### Smart Processing
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles both alarm-based and smart detection webhooks
- **Multiple Thumbnails**: Processes both full scene and cropped license plate images  
- **Fallback Methods**: Direct API calls if webhook URLs unavailable
- **Error Resilience**: Continues processing even if thumbnails fail

### Organized Storage
- **Hierarchical Structure**: `YYYY/MM/DD/` folders for easy navigation
- **Unique Naming**: Hash-based suffixes prevent filename collisions
- **Type Identification**: Clear naming convention for different image types

### Metadata Rich

- **Cross-References**: Links between BigQuery records and GCS files
- **Search Friendly**: Organized structure supports efficient queries

## 🔍 Monitoring & Verification

### Check Processing Status
```bash
# View recent function logs
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_function AND resource.labels.function_name=your-function-name" --limit=50 --format="table(timestamp,severity,textPayload)" --freshness=1h
```

### Verify Thumbnail Storage
```bash
# List recent thumbnails
gsutil ls -l gs://menlo_oaks_thumbnails/$(date +%Y/%m/%d)/ | head -10

# Check bucket statistics
gsutil du -sh gs://menlo_oaks_thumbnails/
```

### Query Thumbnail Success Rate
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE(detection_timestamp) as detection_date,
  COUNT(*) as total_detections,
  COUNT(thumbnail_public_url) as snapshots_stored,
  COUNT(cropped_thumbnail_public_url) as crops_stored,
  ROUND(COUNT(thumbnail_public_url) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as snapshot_success_rate,
  ROUND(COUNT(cropped_thumbnail_public_url) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as crop_success_rate
FROM `menlo-oaks.license_plates_dev.detections`
WHERE detection_timestamp >= DATETIME_SUB(CURRENT_DATETIME(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY detection_date
ORDER BY detection_date DESC;
```
